# We're Going to Space!

Well sort of.. There are a couple of things we need to do first... the boring things, like packing all of our cones and gnomes in to our space rocket.

## What is this?

This is my entry for the [Samsung VR Together Hackathon](https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/virtual-hackathon-lets-make-vr-together-53f629552764). It's a simple-ish Three.js WebVR scene that should work across most devices.

It'll work on your toaster (probably), laptop and computer. 

It'll work on your phone (not the rotary kind...)

## Instructions
On your device open the site: https://blog.omgmog.net/were-going-to-space

If you're using a phone, hit the "Enter VR Mode" button on the bottom right, and put your phone in to your VR headset.

## Future plans

Well this isn't finished. I didn't give myself enough time, and burned a lot of time playing with tweening objects along paths and other stuff.

I've still got a bunch to do:

- add a sense of "levels"
- make the robot collect the item you pick
- make the robot put it on the conveyor belt
- determine whether or not the rocket can take off


... so I'll be tinkering on this when I get some time, and maybe taking it along to any future VR hacks I take part in.


## Development

Here are a bunch of images I made and lovingly shared with the public while building this (animated and not)
