# We're Going to Space!

Well sort of.. There are a couple of things we need to do first... the boring things, like packing all of our cones and gnomes in to our space rocket.

## What is this?

This is my entry for the Samsung VR Together Hackathon. It's a simple-ish Three.js WebVR scene that should work across most devices.

It'll work on your toaster (probably), laptop and computer. 

It'll work on your phone (not the rotary kind...)

## Instructions
On your device open the site: https://blog.omgmog.net/were-going-to-space

If you're using a phone, hit the "Enter VR Mode" button on the bottom right, and put your phone in to your VR headset.


## Development

Here are a bunch of images I made and lovingly shared with the public while building this (animated and not)
